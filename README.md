# 14-day-challenge-projects
Welcome to my 14-day coding challenge! Each day, I build a new mini-project to improve the web development skills I learned from Odins foundations course. This repo hosts all my work from the challenge.

#Project 2: Digital business card

An interactive landing page designed to showcase an example of a business that advertises the creation of digital business cards.

### Features

- **Catchy header** introducing the concept.
- **Call-to-action button** encouraging users to create their own card.
- The example card includes clickable icons linking to:
  - A dummy email (opens default mail app).
  - GitHub website (`github.com`).
  - LinkedIn website (`linkedin.com`).

### How to Use

Open the project folder (`day1-digital-business-card`), then open `index.html` in any modern browser. Play around with the example card and click the icons to see redirections.
